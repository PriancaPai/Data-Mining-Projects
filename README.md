# Data-Mining-Projects

This project contains 2 parts. In the first part, you are asked to implement PCA (Principle Components Analysis) algorithm, project the high-dimensional data to 2 dimensions, and plot the 2-dimensional data points. In the second part, you are asked to implement Apriori and association rule generation algorithms.

Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction Dataset Description: In this part, you are expected to conduct dimensionality reduction on three biomedical data files (pca_a.txt, pca_b.txt, pca_c.txt). In each file, each row represents the record of a patient/sample; the last column is the disease name, and the rest columns are features.

Part 2: Association Analysis Dataset Description: The dataset is about gene expressions (association-rule-test-data.txt). Each row stands for a patient/sample. The last column is the disease name. For the rest columns, they are gene expressions with values Up or Down (Binary Value). For example, the row “Down Down Down Up … AML” can be interpreted as “G1_ Down G2_ Down G3_ Down G4_Up … AML”, and AML is a disease name
